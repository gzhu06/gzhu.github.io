<b>Abstract</b>: Full supervision models for source separation are trained on mixture-source parallel data and have achieved superior performance in recent years. However, large-scale and naturally mixed parallel training data are difficult to obtain for music, and such models are difficult to adapt to mixtures with new sources. Source-only supervision models, in contrast, only require clean sources for training; They learn source models and then apply these models to separate the mixture.
