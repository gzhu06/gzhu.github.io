# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/) at [University or Rochester](https://rochester.edu/), advised by Prof. [Zhiyao Duan](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/~zduan/).
* My research interests lie in the area of audio processing, especially speech processing, including speaker recognition, source separation, text-to-speech, voice conversion and other topics. Now, I'm especially interested in deep generative models in audio. I also had some experiences in music information retrieval. 
* Before joining [AIR lab](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/air/index.html), I received my Master's degree in Acoustics from Physics department at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp). During that time, I mainly worked on computational acoustics, room acoustics, loudspeaker array processing and signal processing.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics from [Kuang Yaming Honors School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/kym_en/) also at Nanjing University. 
* I enjoy playing guitar, especially electric guitar.
