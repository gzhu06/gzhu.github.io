# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. Candidate from [AIR lab](https://labsites.rochester.edu/air/index.html) in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/) at University or Rochester, where I am fortunate to have Prof. [Zhiyao Duan](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/~zduan/) as my advisor. My research interests focus on applying deep learning to a variety of audio applications. 
* Prior to joining AIR lab at the University of Rochester, I obtained my Master's degree in Acoustics from the Physics department at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). During my Master's, I focused on acoustics and signal processing.
* I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics from [Kuang Yaming Honors School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/kym_en/) at Nanjing University. 
* In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, particularly the electric guitar.
