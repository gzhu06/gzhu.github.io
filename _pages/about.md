# About Me
* I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/) at the [University or Rochester](https://rochester.edu/), where I am fortunate to have Prof. [Zhiyao Duan](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/~zduan/).
* My research interests are centered around audio processing, with a focus on speech processing. This includes topics such as speaker recognition, source separation, text-to-speech, and voice conversion. I am particularly interested in using deep generative models for various audio tasks. I also have some experience in music information retrieval.
* Prior to joining the [AIR lab](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/air/index.html) at the University of Rochester, I earned my Master's degree in Acoustics from the Physics department at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp). During my Master's, I focused on computational acoustics, room acoustics, loudspeaker array processing, and signal processing.
* I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics from [Kuang Yaming Honors School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/kym_en/) at Nanjing University. 
* In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, particularly the electric guitar.
